## YouQuest
_A playground/hobby web application/game where you play as yourself_

As of now, YouQuest comes in two flavours:
1. ReactJS ([/react](the react path))
2. VueJS ([/vue](the vue path))

Both projects represent _the same game_ - though in differing stages of development. In neither case is the app anywhere close to being ready for actual use, though the React app is far further along than the Vue app.

Documentation for each sub-project can be found in their respective path's readme files.
